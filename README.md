Concurrent Orchestration in Haskell
=============

This repository contains the slides of a presentation I gave at the Utrecht University computing science colloquium about [Concurrent Orchestration in Haskell](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2088456.1863534), which is based on the Orc language that is being developed at the [Texas University](http://orc.csres.utexas.edu/).
